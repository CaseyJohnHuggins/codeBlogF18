				<p>This is the body of the first entry!</p>

					The biggest difficulty I had encountered while writing this post was in trying to remember how to structure an html document.
					Although the biggest difficulty of the assignment was probably more attributable to getting all the software to behave.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because I had made webpages before, I mostly just re-learned what to put in the header and the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag.
					However, I did learn how to more effectively use git.
				</p>
				<p>
					As far as what resources I used, I mostly just googled it up whenever I had questions, often ending up on stackexchange or the like.
					 The questions I had regarding what to throw in the header were answered in class.
				</p>

				<h2>Assignment 2</h2>

					Oh boy this one was a fun one. css is the devil. Fun fact: width does not add up to 100% all the time. Because that would be logical. <em>However,</em>
					I will grant that fitting an image to its container was surprisingly simple. There's actually a max-width property in css. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Arguably, the coolest thing that happened in the process of completing this week's assignment was the total serendipity when I guessed at the hex value for the orange,
					and somehow got it right. No way I could do that again in a million years. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The most helpful resource for me this time around was attending lecture. The notes I'd managed to take were really helpful in writing the selectors.
					Also helpful to me was the question asked on Piazza about the sell-something button. Until I'd read that question, I hadn't even noticed the shadow in the pictures.
					Other than that, just the occasional sanity checks on stackexchange and w3.
				</p>
				<p>
					Things I had to google up were just little things like "why isn't overflow:hidden working" and "why doesn't width add to 100%?". 
					The latter of the two searches being the most frustrating revelation of the assignment. I did find a solution, and so I knew a way to fix it,
					but I ended up just tweaking the numbers around and approximating what I'd needed to make it work.
