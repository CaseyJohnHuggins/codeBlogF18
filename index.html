				<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
				<p>This is the body of the first entry!</p>
				<p>
					The biggest difficulty I had encountered while writing this post was in trying to remember how to structure an html document.
					Although the biggest difficulty of the assignment was probably more attributable to getting all the software to behave.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because I had made webpages before, I mostly just re-learned what to put in the header and the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag.
					However, I did learn how to more effectively use git.
				</p>
				<p>
					As far as what resources I used, I mostly just googled it up whenever I had questions, often ending up on stackexchange or the like.
					 The questions I had regarding what to throw in the header were answered in class.
				</p>

				<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
				<p>
					Oh boy this one was a fun one. css is the devil. Fun fact: width does not add up to 100% all the time. Because that would be logical. <em>However,</em>
					I will grant that fitting an image to its container was surprisingly simple. There's actually a max-width property in css. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Arguably, the coolest thing that happened in the process of completing this week's assignment was the total serendipity when I guessed at the hex value for the orange,
					and somehow got it right. No way I could do that again in a million years. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The most helpful resource for me this time around was attending lecture. The notes I'd managed to take were really helpful in writing the selectors.
					Also helpful to me was the question asked on Piazza about the sell-something button. Until I'd read that question, I hadn't even noticed the shadow in the pictures.
					Other than that, just the occasional sanity checks on stackexchange and w3.
				</p>
				<p>
					Things I had to google up were just little things like "why isn't overflow:hidden working" and "why doesn't width add to 100%?". 
					The latter of the two searches being the most frustrating revelation of the assignment. I did find a solution, and so I knew a way to fix it,
					but I ended up just tweaking the numbers around and approximating what I'd needed to make it work. 
				</p>

				<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
				<p>
					That feeling when you finally get around to hitting a programming assignment and you hit it hard and fast and knock it out in one sitting!
				</p>
				<p>
					....Okay so that probably wasn't a good idea, but it worked out this time. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This assignment actually worked out really well for me because a lot of it was stuff I'd previously done for classes in the past.
				</p>
				<p>
					The most helpful resource was, once again, the classroom. I can't emphasize that enough. I might look like I'm falling asleep in the 
					middle of the afternoon lectures, but my notebook is packed with notes. I promise. Seriously. If I hadn't gone to class, I wouldn't have 
					known about the glory that is the querySelector function or its friend querySelectorAll. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I only googled things as sanity checks this time around, or the occasional mixup like using ".add" instead of ".push" to append to an array.
					I'm actually starting to come around to Javascript. Before this class, web development was the devil to me.  
				</p>
				<p>
					I had some sweet plans to add some really cool bells and whistles to my code blog this week. That may or may not end up happening. I'll probably end up
					tweaking it when I'm supposed to be working on my next Data Structues assignment.
				</p>

				<h2>Assignment 4</h2>
				<p>
					So as a first matter of business, I've realized that I should probably reverse the ordering of these blog posts to put the most recent at the top. 
					The aforementioned bells and whistles also never made it to fruition. Anyway, on to the business of Assignment 4!
				</p>
				<p>
					If it's all the same with you, I'm just going to use a &lt;dl&gt; this time.

					<dt>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</dt>
					<dd>This wasn't a massively challenging assignment. I don't think so, anyway. I'm kind of worried I missed something, because so far 
						it just seems like I've thrown a couple lines of script into a file and "boom" server. 
					</dd>
					<dt>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</dt>
					<dd>I have learned that node.js is very cooperative, and the fs module is excellent.</dd>
					<dt>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</dt>
					<dd>Going to class was super helpful. My notebook was my most referenced resource.</dd>
					<dt>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</dt>
					<dd>I had to google how to set my environment variables from Windows Command Prompt so I could test different ports.</dd>
